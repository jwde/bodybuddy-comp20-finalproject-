Status Report 2

BodyBuddy (Formerly known as FitTrack)

Accomplishments of the week:

1. Finished all static elements of the site
2. Researched authentication methods in depth
3. Changed the name and design of the frontend due to a product with a similar name
4. Created our dynamic page using the template language jade
5. Wrote out a basic outline of how our database will store the workouts and created algorithm for generating workouts
6. Obtained oauth keys for google apis

Challenges of the week:

Our original idea for the workout generation algorithm, which would select workout from collections of exercieses separated by muscle groups, was scrapped due to lack of utility.  Most of the workouts for our goals will be relatively static.  This was mostly done to simplify things for the user so they aren't constantly having to learn new exercises.

Figuring out how to use authentication frameworks has been a challenge, mainly because it's not always clear where the authentication data is being stored.  By next week we should have a better understanding of this and be able to implement a login to our program with ease.

Brett essentially redesigned the entire aesthetic of our site this week as well, so kudos to him!

Goals for the next week:

We plan to have the database finished and have begun working on the dynamic aspects of the server this week.  We will hash out the details tomorrow during our hangout.
